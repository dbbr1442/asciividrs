this is an absolute piece of garbage for many reasons: im terrible at rust as i jsut started learning it but couldnt be bothered to watch a tutorial, i couldnt decide what this project should actually be about so i changed my mind about 3 times, im bad at nix, i set up the project dumbly for example writing in absolute paths into the code, also there are bugs im too lazy to fix
IF YOU WANT THIS TO WORK ON YOUR SYSTEM YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS
